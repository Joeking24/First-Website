  Main - I decided to split it up into distinct sections to hopefully facilitate later changes that could be more specific if necessary. This definitely made it a little harder to do the CSS for these elements, as different elements have similar names. I worked around it, but it might be a thing to think about for the future.
  I also found that the liberal use of tabs helped me visualize the layout/sections nicely as I was working.

          <h3>I'm Joe!</h3>
          <p>I am an aspiring software developer currently living in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
          <p>In my life so far, I have pursued a few of my passions as potential career paths. These include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Teaching kids outdoor living skills in a primitive setting</li>
            <li>Classically-trained vocal performance</li>
            <li>Culinary arts</li>
          </ul>
          <footer>
            <p>It is my goal to incorporate the skills and learning strategies I have learned in these pursuits into my future endeavors!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have always been interested in how computers work. Whether it be the actual hardware of the computer itself, programs that I use frequently, video games, or webpages. My growing interest in these types of topics has pushed me to follow this path towards a potential career.</p>
        <p>So far, each new thing I have learned has created many more questions that spawn their own ideas as well. The learning process seems unending as technology continues to evolve. Having the chance to take part in this process is already filling me with joy and I hope to continue to do so!</p>
        <p>I am very excited to start sharing my passion for web development and software engineering with others who might feel the same way. In my opinion, sharing ideas with other people is how even greater ideas are formed. I hope to be able to start to build a network of individuals who are interested in these topics, as that will help all of us in the long run!</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, cooking new and exciting foods, perfecting my existing recipes, watching anime, and listening to all different kinds of music!</p>
        <p>Thanks for taking a look at my website! If you have any comments or questions, feel free to contact me using the links at the bottom of the page!</p>
